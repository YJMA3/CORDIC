# CORDIC

A 16-bit CORDIC computer. The design to be implemented is based on a bit-serial configuration. It will take as input a 16-bit signed binary
fixed point number, corresponding to an angle in the range 0 to Ï€/2, and use the CORDIC method to find the sine and cosine of this angle. This will be coded in Verilog and implemented on the Basys 3 board.
